# Contributing to pytorch-vit

First off, thank you for considering contributing to pytorch-vit. It's people like you that make pytorch-vit such a great tool.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the pytorch-vit Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to prestongov@gmail.com.

## What we are looking for

pytorch-vit is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into pytorch-vit itself.

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email prestongov@gmail.com instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

- Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
- Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you are probably dealing with a security issue. Otherwise, open an issue.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in pytorch-vit, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that pytorch-vit has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Your first contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to pytorch-vit? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your fix or feature.
4. Implement your changes, including tests if applicable.
5. Run the project's tests to ensure your changes don't cause any regressions.
6. Submit a pull request with a description of your changes.

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code.
2. Do the changes in your fork.
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:

    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Note the pytorch-vit Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request.

## How to set up your environment and run tests

Please see the [README.md](README.md) for how to set up your environment and run tests.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests that cover the new functionality.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters if necessary.
3. Ensure that your code follows the existing style in the project to maintain the project's overall consistency.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. The pull request should work for Python3.11.

Thank you for contributing!
